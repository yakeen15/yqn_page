    <h1>What is calculus?</h1>
    <p>In a nutshell, calculus is the study of the rate of change
        of a "system". A system is anything that we are conducting
        our studies on. It can be dynamic (that is, changing) or static.
        Regardless of what we are studying, if we find ourselves working
        with rates of change, it can be identified as a calculus problem.
        However, calculus doesn't just stop there, we can use it to describe
        the motion of almost anything, to find the area or volume of any geometric
        shape, or to find the amount of interest we can get from a continuously
        compounding asset.
