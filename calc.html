    <h1>What is calculus?</h1>
    <p>In a nutshell, calculus is the study of the rate of change
        of a "system". A system is anything that we are conducting
        our studies on. It can be dynamic (that is, changing) or static.
        Regardless of what we are studying, if we find ourselves working
        with rates of change, it can be identified as a calculus problem.
        However, calculus doesn't just stop there, we can use it to describe
        the motion of almost anything, to find the area or volume of any geometric
        shape, or to find the amount of interest we can get from a continuously
        compounding asset.

    <p>Applications of calculus are everywhere, including but not limited to</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Finding the speed, velocity and direction of any body in motion</li>
        <li>Physics based video games such as Human Fall Flat</li>
        <li>In finance and banking that requires calculation of interest rates</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Topics in calculus</h1>
    <p>Are you interested in studying calculus? Great! Now we will dive
         into all the things that are necessary for you to learn before 
         trying to learn calculus, which are aptly titled <b>Pre-calculus</b>.
         This includes topics from trigonometry, algebra and introduction to 
         functions. After studying and mastering the topics in pre-calculus, 
         we can move onto the main foundational branches of calculus, <b>Differential
            calculus
         </b> and <b>Integral calculus</b>. All the topics are listed below.
