    <h1>Welcome to Luminocity, a webpage/blog(ish) by Shajiratul Yaqueen!</h1>
    <p>
        I am Shajiratul Yaqueen, currently a final years student in 
        the department of Applied Mathematics, University of Dhaka. 
        I created this page to write about things that interest me, 
        and also to practice what I have learnt self-studying web-
        development. I hope you like what you find here!
